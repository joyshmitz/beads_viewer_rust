## Unreleased (0.1.0-dev)

### Phase 7 -- TUI Semantic Redesign and Recommendation Schema (2026-03-21)

A visual-primitive refactor laying the groundwork for a full TUI redesign,
alongside richer robot recommendation payloads and triage behavioral fixes.

#### TUI Visual Primitives

Introduces a semantic tone system and reusable panel/summary-line primitives
(`semantic_panel_block`, styled detail lines) so that future TUI redesign
work can compose screens from a consistent visual vocabulary instead of
ad-hoc rendering.

- Add semantic tone system and reusable visual primitives for TUI.
  ([8f470d0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/8f470d029e37fe09db2aaa7f8bb45c65f88d7913))
- Refactor TUI panels to use `semantic_panel_block` and add styled detail
  summary lines.
  ([aec6a15](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/aec6a1548add1213403753a9143807f4238e260b))
- Add reusable visual primitives for TUI redesign.
  ([745a875](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/745a8752b1625c42079e25cb2937487b249c997b))

#### TUI Debug Rendering

New debug render modes let developers inspect layout geometry, hit-test
regions, and the combined capture view without running the full interactive
loop.

- Add layout and hit-test debug rendering modes for `render_debug_view`.
  ([96c8f41](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/96c8f41bf16928195a263b65a6d6387904935278))
- Add capture debug render mode combining view, layout, and hit-test output.
  ([d290f50](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/d290f505a43ef6b004502b5b860799cb4e01dc19))
- Remove dead code, improve list panel rendering and cursor detection.
  ([e70212d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/e70212d5a0dba25b05d533be3c2c3c0260e16d4f))

#### Robot Recommendation Schema

Recommendation payloads now carry `action`, `blocked_by`, `unblocks_ids`, and
`type` fields so agents can act on a recommendation without making extra
lookups into the issue graph.

- Enrich recommendation schema with action/blocked_by/unblocks_ids/type.
  ([6c4e938](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/6c4e9388025704b19da5d8e0ff1062b38906c9d1))
- Expand debug render views and enrich robot recommendation schema.

#### Triage Behavioral Changes

Items with `in_progress` status are now excluded from `top_picks` and
`highest_impact` in both triage and plan outputs, because recommending
work that is already underway wastes agent attention.

- Exclude `in_progress` items from `top_picks` and `highest_impact`.
  ([5944716](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/59447162f98f6c86a51f1a49b600e76addd33049))

#### Export

- Upgrade `history.json` in pages bundles to match `--robot-history` output
  shape for consistent downstream consumption.
  ([d48952c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/d48952cc837f6048556672837441708eb86201b2))

#### Bug Fixes

- Always serialize `commits` and `cycle_time` fields as `null` in history
  output for consistent downstream parsing.
  ([5ffbc3a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/5ffbc3a0538ae1b5287a0b373f1c07bde8170b5a))

  could produce wrong confidence scores on platforms where usize differs from
  the expected integer width.
  ([1ef2ce1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/1ef2ce1a47fa7b8c088b37bfc94a763c797923e6))

---

### Phase 6 -- Export Hardening, E2E Coverage, and Parity Closure (2026-03-18 to 2026-03-20)

Closes the last parity gaps with the legacy Go `bv`, hardens path resolution
across workspace and export flows, and significantly expands end-to-end test
coverage.

#### Path Resolution and Workspace Loading

A family of bugs where export paths, hook contexts, and workspace repo paths
were resolved relative to the wrong directory (cwd instead of workspace root
or project dir).

- Resolve relative export paths from workspace root, not cwd.

- Error when all workspace repos fail to load instead of silently returning
  an empty issue set.
  ([b830bca](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/b830bcae881af87a46895fa1beac089921d0f709))

### Phase 4 -- Typed Timestamps, SQLite Export, FlowMatrix, and TUI Expansion (2026-03-08 to 2026-03-11)

Foundational refactors (typed timestamps, two-phase graph analysis) and major
new surfaces (SQLite export, FlowMatrix view, pages wizard). This phase also
introduced mouse support and several new TUI view modes.

#### Typed Timestamp Migration

All timestamp fields migrated from `Option<String>` to
`Option<DateTime<Utc>>`, then every analysis, TUI, export, and CLI layer
adapted to the new types. This eliminated a class of bugs around inconsistent
date parsing and comparison.

- Migrate timestamp fields in the data model.
  ([10f8235](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/10f823549f408686d9f7db7ffe6e20a355c82bbd))

### Phase 2 -- Core Parity, Workspace Support, and Robot Surface Expansion (2026-02-27)

A single intensive day of development covering workspace loading, sprint and
metrics commands, graph-panel redesign, and the robot-capacity/alerts
subcommands. This phase also introduced stress-test fixtures and the
conformance test expansion that became the foundation for later parity work.

#### Robot Commands

- Add `robot-capacity` and `robot-alerts` subcommands with full
  implementation.
  ([0332c96](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/0332c96daa28059e35b6a1ab90782f8f727c906b))

#### Workspace Support

- Add workspace support (`.bv/workspace.yaml`), markdown export,
  sprint/metrics robot commands, and historical revision loading.
  ([c0bff04](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer_rust/commit/c0bff049149a6dd73bfd474412196fc0c03c8171))

### Phase 1 -- Repository Initialization (2026-02-18 to 2026-02-25)

The project was bootstrapped as a Rust port of the legacy Go `bv` tool.
The initial commit already contained 26,278 lines across a substantial
codebase -- this was not a from-zero start but a structured port with an
already-functional core.

#### Data Model and Loader

- Full data model (`model.rs`) for beads issues with status, priority, type,
  labels, dependencies, comments, and assignees.
- Loader (`loader.rs`) for `.beads/` directories with compatibility filename
  detection (`beads.jsonl`, `issues.jsonl`, `beads.base.jsonl`).

#### Analysis Engine

- Graph construction and centrality: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector
  centrality, k-core decomposition.
- Cycle detection via strongly connected components.
- Critical path / critical depth computation and slack analysis.
- Articulation point detection for structural failure points.
- Alert generation for stale/blocking cascades.
- Forecast module for ETA predictions.
- Diff module for baseline snapshot comparison.
- Suggest module for dependency and hygiene suggestions.
- Plan module for parallel execution track grouping.
- Git history correlation (`git_history.rs`) and issue lifecycle history.
- Label intelligence.

#### Robot Output

- Structured JSON robot output mode (`robot.rs`) for agent and script
  consumption.

#### Interactive TUI

- FrankenTUI (`tui.rs`, 3,654 lines at init) with main issue list/detail
  view built on the `ftui` crate.

#### Testing Infrastructure

- Conformance test suite (1,177 lines) with Go reference harness and
  fixtures.
- Integration tests for robot-alerts, robot-burndown, and robot-history.
- Triage benchmarks (`benches/triage.rs`).
- Test data: `minimal.jsonl`, `adversarial_parity.jsonl`,
  `synthetic_complex.jsonl`.

#### Infrastructure

- Switch `asupersync` and `ftui` dependencies from local paths to crates.io.
